This repository hosts the code from [The chromatin landscape of healthy and injured cell types in the human kidney](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.06.07.543965v1). We aim to unravel the molecular underpinnings of kidney diseases and create targeted therapies. Our work maps gene activation and repression in kidney cells across various states - healthy, injured, or repairing."
